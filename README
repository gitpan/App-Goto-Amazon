NAME
    App::Goto::Amazon - Shorthand way of ssh'ing to AWS EC2 servers

SYNOPSIS
      use App::Goto::Amazon;

DESCRIPTION
    App::Goto::Amazon is called by the included 'ssa' script. If no
    arguments are supplied, ssa will simply print a list of running EC2
    instances. If arguments are supplied, then the script will look for an
    instance whose name matches all supplied arguments (in order) and, if it
    finds one, will ssh to it. If the arguments are ambiguous, the first
    match will be used

    Requires your Amazon keys in a ~/.ssa file - see ssa.example file for
    template
